# ferret.js
Lets create a efficient JS to GLSL compiler + an awesome GPU computing library.


Estimated date of completion: 2019

### Goals

Create the most efficient JS to GLSL compiler. The compiling is the bane of accessable GPU computing libraries, such as GPU.js. Compiling makes it slow. Lets make it fast - hopefully.
